    <h1>Some Good Movies According to Fred</h1>

    <h2>A few of my top movies of all time...</h2>

    <hr>

    <h3>Interstellar</h3>
    <p>I love anything to do with space, interstellar travel and black holes. Bonus as it was based on real science (though they did take some liberties!).</p>

    <h3>Inception</h3>
    <p>Another Christopher Nolan classic. The visuals were jaw dropping for its time. Great cast, great story, and just great entertainment.</p>

    <h3>Dune</h3>
    <p>One of my favourite books in the hands of one of my favourite directors, Denis Villenueve. Breathtaking visuals and story telling!</p>
